# olauncher
The original launcher we all know and love with the quality-of-life features of the new launcher.

## TODO
- Add Microsoft authentication (DONE)
- Add skin/cape management
- Allow account switching
- Add built-in JVMs (use java 8 for some versions and 17 for others)

### Lower priority stuff
- Switch from `version_manifest` to `version_manifest_v2`
- Try to maintain support for Java 8 to latest (Still working)
